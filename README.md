# Airbnb-Analysis-Seattle
This is My very first Data Analysis Poject using Airbnb Data for Seattle which describes the listing activities of Housing-Stays at Seattle, WA

# Inspiration
The Project is part of my Udacity Nanodegree Program. My Aim is to seek some insights from Airbnb Data in order to leverage Business Decisions and some suggestions for Future Hosts.

# Project Overview
My Whole Project is summed up in "Seattle Airbnb.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook which contains following major phases-
1. Importing the Libraries and Dataset
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Data Preparation
4. Building Predictive Model for Estimated Revenue

# Dataset Overview
This dataset is part of Airbnb Inside, and the original source can be found [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)

The following Airbnb activity is included in this Seattle dataset:

1. Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
2. Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
3. Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

# Installation Required
1. Python Jupyter Notebook ([Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/))
2. Dataset ([From Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data))

# Libraries Used
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-Learn

# Quesions I tried to address by observing Data -
These questions which I addressed are not only for Airbnb's Business but also gives some insights for future hosts that they can observe and implement for making more from platform

(1) What is the Peak Season of Housing at Seattle in terms of Price?

(2) What is the Peak Season of Housing at Seattle in terms of Revenue?

(3) Is there any importance of Permission of Guests allowed by Host on Listings?

(4) Is there any Importance of Verification for Future Hosts?

(5) What is the general Nature of Seattle Hosts from Social Perspective?

(6) Is Company really providing any Benefits toHosts identified as “SuperHost” in terms of Revenue?

# My Findings

(1) What is the Peak Season of Housing at Seattle in terms of Price?

From below Figure it can be clearly observed that Highest Price Season for Airbnb at Seattle is from June-August which are generally due to Vacations and litte increase in December due to Christmas and New Year leading to Inflation of Hosing Price whereas there is no trend (Noise) in Pricing based on Day of Month 

 

(2) What is the Peak Season of Housing at Seattle in terms of Revenue?

In Contrast to Peak Season or Inflation Sason in terms of pricing, Peak Revenue Months are quite different because February and May are the Months which are providing Great Revenue as compared to Holiday Seasons when although Price is High but may be due to Competition Earnings are quite Low.
 
 


(3) Is there any importance of Permission of Guests allowed by Host on Listings?

From figures below, it is very clear that most of the Host allows 1-2 Guests with Customers and pricing also look in accordance with Frequency of Guetsts but for future Hosts if they can accommodate 5-6 Guests than it would be very great because of less competition and Good Revenue in return.

 
 



(4) Is there any Importance of Verification for Future Hosts?

Look it is interesting that most Hosts generally get their Identity Verified to satisfy customer's security concerns but in Seattle it looks like Estimated Revenue of non verified hosts are more than verifed ones which is interesting insight showing that being Verified Host is not adding any value in terms of Earnings of Hosts.

 

(5) What is the general Nature of Seattle Hosts from Social Perspective?

Here is unique thing to note not from Business Perspective but from Social Perspective that in Today's World where lots people migrate for jobs actually try to get single rooms or shared rooms rather than Whole House due to limited Funds but in Seattle most of the hosts offers Entire Home maybe targeting families but not very hosts are targetting singles or students who can't afford whole house which shows that Most hosts are Business Minded rather than Social Support which in turn can bring Good Revenue due to less Competition and High Demand (In General).
 

(6) Is Company really providing any Benefits toHosts identified as “SuperHost” in terms of Revenue?

As we saw in case of host who are verified or not, here also same situation is present with hosts those are superhost or not. Here again although there are very few host that have tag of superhost which is natural as it is difficult to reach upto that level and requirements but those hosts who are not superhost they have almost equivalent pricing as of superhost and if that is the case than customer will choose Host with Superhost Tag as Normal Host have very high Price being Verified, so SuperHost are in Benefit and Future Host can reduce their Pricing Plan in oreder to compete with SuperHost which is not the case in Current Situation.
