# Airbnb-Analysis-Seattle
This is My very first Data Analysis Poject using Airbnb Data for Seattle which describes the listing activities of Housing-Stays at Seattle, WA

# Inspiration
The Project is part of my Udacity Nanodegree Program. My Aim is to seek some insights from Airbnb Data in order to leverage Business Decisions and some suggestions for Future Hosts.

# Project Overview
My Whole Project is summed up in "Seattle Airbnb.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook which contains following major phases-
1. Importing the Libraries and Dataset
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Data Preparation
4. Building Predictive Model for Estimated Revenue

# Dataset Overview
This dataset is part of Airbnb Inside, and the original source can be found [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)

The following Airbnb activity is included in this Seattle dataset:

1. Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
2. Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
3. Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

# Installation Required
1. Python Jupyter Notebook ([Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/))
2. Dataset ([From Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data))

# Libraries Used
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-Learn

# Quesions I tried to address by observing Data -
These questions which I addressed are not only for Airbnb's Business but also gives some insights for future hosts that they can observe and implement for making more from platform

(1) What is the Peak Season of Housing at Seattle in terms of Price?

(2) What is the Peak Season of Housing at Seattle in terms of Revenue?

(3) Is there any importance of Permission of Guests allowed by Host on Listings?

(4) Is there any Importance of Verification for Future Hosts?
